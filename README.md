# ClassicalComposers
MySQL projects for a class I took at Oregon State University

OtherSQL contains a definition project where I add entries to a database and a selection project where I was querying a film/actor database.

ClassicalComposers was my final project for this class. I built a database of composers and pieces of classical music using PHP and MySQL. The Report.pdf document in the folder explains the project more fully.
